Step 1: Get the Three Key Price Sources
    KBB Excellent Trade-in Value (we add $500 to this)
    JD Power Retail Value
    KBB Retail Value
Step 2: Handle Missing Values
    If JD Power value is missing, use KBB Retail value instead
    If KBB Retail value is missing, use JD Power value instead
Step 3: Determine the Retail Value
    Take the LOWER of JD Power Retail or KBB Retail value
    This becomes our "retail value" benchmark
Step 4: Calculate Our Costs
    Certification Cost: Varies by state (for making the car certified pre-owned)
    Reconditioning Cost: Fixed at $400 (for cleaning and basic repairs)
    Profit: Fixed at $1,500 (our target profit)
    Total Costs: Add all three costs together
Step 5: Calculate Initial Offer
    If we have a KBB Trade-in value:
    Start with KBB Trade-in value + $500
    Check if this offer + our total costs is LESS than the retail value
    If not, keep reducing the offer by $500 until it fits
    If no KBB Trade-in value:
    Simply do: Retail Value - Total Costs
Step 6: Round the Offer
    Round down to the nearest $500 (so $4,750 becomes $4,500)
Step 7: Final Adjustments
    Make sure our offer is at least $1,500 BELOW the seller's asking price
    If not, adjust the offer to: Seller's Price - $1,500
Step 8: Final Decision
    If offer is $500 or less: Manual review needed
    If seller's price is $5,000+ higher than our offer: PASS (too expensive)
    Otherwise: Make the calculated OFFER
