First of all, Program checks all the values from monday has for an item.
-> Vin
-> Mileage
-> State
-> Price$
-> Vehicle title
-> Series
-> URL


**If vin is not 17 character, program will write an Upadte saying "Vin is not correct" and will set the status to "Invalid Vin"

**If either of mileage/state/price is empty or 0, program will write an Update saying "VIN / Mileage / State / Price / vehicle is(are) empty" and will set the status to "Empty Value"


If the item satisfied above rules, program will start appraising the item.

1. Program will take below values from laser screen
    -> ***KBB Trade Excellent Value***
    -> ***JD power Retail Value***
    -> ***KBB Misc Retails value***
2. If all of the baove values are 0 or null, Program will create an update saying "-Manual- Couldn't get values value 0/NAN" and will set the status to "Manual"

3.First program will apraise only using ***JD power Retail Value*** and  ***KBB Misc Retails value***. First progran will take the lowest of the two values. Let's say "***Min of JD retail and KBB retail value***"

5. Then, program will take nearest 500 value of ***Min of JD retail and KBB retail value***.

6. Certification cost will be deducted . Near state has $800 certification cost and far states has $1100 certification costs.
    near:[
        'Pennsylvania',
        'Maryland',
        'Delaware',
        'New Jersey',
        'New York',
        'Ohio'
    ],
    far:[
        'Maine',
        'Vermont',
        'New Hampshire',
        'Massachusetts',
        'Rhode Island',
        'Connecticut',
        'West Virginia',
        'Virginia',
        'North Carolina',
        'South Carolina',
        'Georgia',
        'Florida',
        'Alabama',
        'Mississippi',
        'Tennessee',
        'Kentucky',
        'Indiana',
        'Michigan',
        'Illinois',
        'Wisconsin',
        'Minnesota',
        'Iowa',
        'Missouri',
        'Texas',
        'Arkansas',
        'Oklahoma',
        'Kansas',
        'North Dakota',
    ]

5. After that, Recondition cost of $2000 wil be deducted
6. Then, $2000 profit will be deducted
7. Now, if the calculated value and seller asking price has a difference lower than $2000, calculated value will replaced by sellerPrice-$2000
8. Now, If nearest 500 value of ***KBB Trade Excellent Value*** is less than the calculated value, calculated value will be replaced by nearest 500 value of ***KBB Trade Excellent Value***.

Now, we can call this calculated value as "MMC Offer"

Finalization:
1. If difference between mmcOffer and seller Asking price is more than 5000, Program will create a status saying "-PASS $- Seller asking 5k+" and will set status to "PASS$". Else, Program will create a update saying "-OFFER-" and will set the status to "Initital Offer"
